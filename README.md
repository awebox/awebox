AWEbox is a Python toolbox for modelling and optimal control of multiple-kite systems for Airborne Wind Energy (AWE). It provides interfaces that aim to take away from the user the burden of

- generating optimization-friendly high-fidelity system dynamics for different modeling options.
- formulating and solving the trajectory optimization problem efficiently and reliably, also for long time horizons
- postprocessing and visualizing the solution and performing quality checks
- tracking MPC design and solver generation for closed-loop simulations

The main focus of the toolbox are _rigid-wing_, _lift_- and _drag_-mode multiple-kite systems.

## Implemented aircraft models

- Ampyx AP2 (6DOF)
- MegAWES (6DOF)
- point-mass model with lift and roll control (3DOF)

## Installation

`awebox` runs on Python 3. It depends heavily on the modeling language CasADi, which is a symbolic framework for algorithmic differentiation. CasADi also provides the interface to the NLP solver IPOPT.  
It is optional but highly recommended to use HSL linear solvers as a plugin with IPOPT.

1.   Get a local copy of the latest `awebox` release:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/awebox/awebox.git
     ```

2.   Install using pip

     ```
     pip3 install awebox/
     ```

3.   In order to get the HSL solvers and render them visible to CasADi, follow these [instructions](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/Obtaining-HSL). Additional installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/awebox/awebox/blob/develop/INSTALLATION.md).


## Getting started

To run one of the examples from the `awebox` root folder:

```
python3 examples/ampyx_ap2_trajectory.py
```
